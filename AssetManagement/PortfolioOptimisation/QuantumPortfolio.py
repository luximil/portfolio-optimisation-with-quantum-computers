        ----------
        asset_manager_param : float
            Expresses the trade-off between risk and return. Setting it to 0
            maximises return only. Setting it to 1 minimises volatility only.
        net_positions : int
            Only portfolios with exactly this number of positions, i.e.,
            non-zero elements, will be considered feasible solutions in the
            soft-constraint.
        alpha : float
            Penalty parameter for the cardinality soft-constraint.
        beta : float
            Penalty parameters for the degenerate solutions infeasibility
            soft-constraint.
        cov_matrix : pandas.DataFrame
            Covariance matrix of asset returns.
        expected_returns : pandas.Series
            Expected returns indexed vector.
        transaction_costs : pandas.Series
            Indexed vector containing the transaction costs of each asset in
            percentage terms.
        initial_portfolio : pandas.Series
            Indexed vector containing the initial portfolio asset weights,
            which will be considered in the computation of transaction costs
            when rebalancing the portfolio from initial_portfolio to optimal
            portfolio.
        test_runs : int, default 20
            Number of random binary vectors of size 2*N used to test that each
            QUBO matrix used to construct the final Q matrix were correctly
            constructed.
        test_tol : float, default 10e-8
            Maximum deviations from the actual value allowed in the testing of
            each QUBO matrix used to construct the final Q matrix were
            correctly constructed.
        qs_export_path : str, default None
            If not None, the resulting Q matrix is exported in .qs integer
            format to this path.
        export_decimal_places : int, default 4
            Number of decimal places to round the entries in Q before export.
        simplify : bool, default True
            If True, the computed Hamiltonian is simplified using the .simplfy
            method from Pennylane. This can help reduce the number of elements
            needed to define the Hamiltonian. If False, no simplify method is
            applied to the computed Hamiltonian.

            Hamiltonian to define a layer in the QAOA circuit. The order of

            bit-string, where i-th bit-string is equal to the binary
